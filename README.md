# bucket-sync

Sync two buckets, even across isolated regions.

You probably don't need this unless you are operating in China and have to
sync data between an S3 bucket there and one in the rest of the world.

## Usage

    lein run -- someconfig.clj

Where someconfig.clj follows the pattern of config/example.clj
